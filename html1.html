    <h2>summary</h2>
    <p>
   Once upon a time, a farmer had a goose that laid a golden egg every day.
 The farmer used to sell that egg and earn enough money to meet their family's day-to-day needs.
 One day, the farmer thought that if he could get more such golden eggs and make a lot of money and become a wealthy person. 
 The farmer decided to cut the goose and remove all the golden eggs from its stomach.<br> 
 As soon as they killed the bird and opened the gooseâ€™s stomach, they found no eggs. 
 The foolish farmer realized they had destroyed their last resource out of greed.

      <pre>
         <p>
             Because I could not stop for Death,

                  He kindly stopped for me;
 
            The carriage held but just ourselves
 
                     And Immortality.
